Longboats have been sighted the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgement day has come around so be prepared don't run stand your ground

They're coming in from the sea
they've come the enemy
beneath the blazing sun
the battle has to be won
Invaders ... Pillaging
Invaders ... Looting

Set ablaze the campfires alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements we cannot fight this battle alone

They're coming over the hill
they've come to attack
they're coming in for the kill
there's no turning back
Invaders ... Fighting
Invaders ... Marauding

Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle weary fight to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen

You'd better scatter and run
the battle's lost and not won
you'd better get away
to fight another day
Invaders ... Raping
Invaders ... Plundering

He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home

Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned

He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would've crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought oblivion, well, it beckons us all

Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned

Now it's burning his hands, he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground. What did we learn?

You're children of the damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
You're children of the damned

Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight
Children of the damned
I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feeling dead on my feet
Going all the way, I'm natures beast
Do what I want and do as I please

Run - Fight - To breathe - It's tough
Now you see me now you don't
Break the walls I'm coming out

Not a prisoner I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going ...out!

If you kill me it's self defense
And if I kill ya' then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye I will defy
You'll be afraid when I call out your name

Run - Fight - To breathe - It's gonna be tough
Now you see me now you don't
Break the walls I'm coming out

Not a prisoner I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going

I'm not a number I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
Cause' I'll run rings around you

If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia Avenue meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice

If you're waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me and you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it she'll teach you more than you can know

Charlotte can't you get out from all of this madness
Can't you see it only brings you sadness
When you entertain your men don't you know the risk of getting disease

Some day when you're reaching the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show any more

22 the avenue that's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside the red light's burning bright tonight

Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay

Sometimes when you're strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you

22 the avenue that's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside the red light's burning bright tonight

Beat her mistreat her do anything that you please
Bite her excite her make her get down on her knees
Abuse her misuse her she can take all that you've got
Caress her molest her she always does what you want

You're running away don't you know what you're doing
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning
Your life's good don't you know that you're hurting
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags and you're coming with me

"Woe to you, Oh Earth and Sea, for the Devil sends the
beast with wrath, because he knows the time is short...
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the
beast for it is a human number, its number is Six hundred and
sixty six."

I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
that night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw in my old dreams were they
reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

'Cos in my dream it's always there the evil face that twists my mind
and brings me to despair

The night was black was no use holding back
'Cos I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was this all for real or some kind of hell
666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
666 the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the evil chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerise me ... can't avoid their eyes
666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me

I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take it's course

White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need

We fought him hard we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?

Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom's a stab in the back
Women and children the cowards attack

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's a game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Run to the hills,
run for your lives.
Run to the hills,
run for your lives.

Yeah oh ah!

Run to the hills,
run for your lives.
Run to the hills,
run for your lives.

Run to the hills,
run for your lives.
Run to the hills,
run for your lives.

Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile

Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - murders up for sale
Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - where jail birds die

Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long 'till they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive

Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone but alive for how long?

Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - murders up for sale
Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - where jail birds die

A knife at your throat another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blacked out jail

Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - murders up for sale
Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - where jail birds die

In Gangland you tell no tales

Cold as steel the darkness waits its hour will come.
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun.
Mother natures' black revenge on those who wasted her life.
War babies in the garden of Eden,
Shall turn our ashes to ice.

Sunrise has gone, freezing up the fires.
Sunrise has gone, numbing our desires.

Around the world the people stop,
With terror stricken eyes.
A shadow cast upon them all,
To crush them like a fly.
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas,
There's nowhere left to run.
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane.

Sunrise has gone, freezing up the fires.
Sunrise has gone, numbing our desires.

Around the world the nations wait,
For some wise word from their leading light.
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools.
Is this the end, the millions cried,
Clutching their riches as they died.
Those who survive must weather the storm.

Gone are the days when man looked down.
They've taken away his sacred crown.
To be set free, it took so long.
It's not journey's end, it's just begun.

I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of an error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?

Somebody, please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears, they flow but why am I crying?
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody calls from a cell, "God be with you!"
If there's a god, why has he let me go?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly away

Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Hallowed be thy name

It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
of engines roar in the night,
The mission is near the confident men
are waiting to drop from the sky.

The Blizzard goes on but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare.

Bavarian alps that lay all around
they seem to stare from below,
The enemy lines a long time passed
are lying deep in the snow.

Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare.

They're closing in the fortress is near
it's standing high in the sky,
The cable car's the only way in
it's really impossible to climb.

They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day.

The panicking cries the roaring of guns
are echoing all around the valley,
The mission complete they make to escape
away from the Eagles Nest.

They dared to go where no one would try
they chose to fly where eagles dare.
"O God of Earth and Altar,
Bow down and hear our cry,
Our earthly rulers falter,
Our people drift and die,
The walls of gold entomb us,
The swords of scorn divide,
Take not thy thunder from us,
Take away our pride."
[G.K. Chesterton: English Hymnal]

Just a babe in a black abyss,
No reason for a place like this,
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
An easy way for the blind to go,
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the Hanged Man - the smile of his lips.

The light of the Blind - you'll see,
The venom tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.

She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips,
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
So we lay in a black embrace,
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the Dawn.

The light of the Blind - you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.

Go

Bind all of us together,
Ablaze with Hope and Free,
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain,
For the one who will be King
Is the Watcher in the Ring.
It is You.
It is You.

As the sun breaks, above the ground,
An old man stands on the hill.
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still.

His eyes are ablaze,
See the madman in his gaze.

Fly on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly and touch the sun.

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly.

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream.
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun.
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly, touch the sun
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly

Fly as high as the sun.
Another prophet of disaster
Who says the ship is lost,
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost.

Taunting us with visions,
Afflicting us with fear,
Predicting war for millions,
In the hope that one appears.

The warlord will arise,

Terror, death, destruction,
Pour from the eastern sands,

Die!

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back.

The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death.

The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall.

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day.

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below.

And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan.

Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me.

Oh.....I've never felt so strange
But.....I'm not going insane.

I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do.

Oh.....they drain my strength away
Oh.....they're asking me to stay.

Nightmares.....spirits calling me
Nightmares.....they won't leave me be.

All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool.

Now.....I feel they are so near
I.....begin to see them clear

Nightmares.....coming all the time
Nightmares.....Will give me peace of mind.

Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too.

Oh.....we'll drown together
It.....will be forever.

Nightmares.....forever calling me
Nightmares.....Now we rest in peace.

In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam.

Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
to save the power of warmth and light.

Drawn by Quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by Quest for fire
Discovery of man.

And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.

So they ploughed through forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of life and heat.

Drawn by Quest for fire
They searched across the land
Drawn by Quest for fire
Discovery of man.

Well, you killed your first man at 13,
Killer instinct, Animal supreme,
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel

Through earth and water, fire and wind,
You came at last - nothing was the end,
Make a cut by fire and stones,
Take you and your blade and break you both
in two - break you both in two.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on.

He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow.

He rules the sand worms and the Fremen
In the land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow.

He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
In the land called "Planet Dune".

Bodywater is your life
And without it you would die
In the desert, the planet Dune.

Without a stillsuit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis.

It is a land that's rich in spice
The sandriders and the "mice"
That they call the "Muad Dib".

He is the Kwizatz Haderach.
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar.

He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars.

The time will come for him to lay claim his crown,
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down,
You'll see
He'll be
The best that there's been,
Messiah supreme
True leader of men,

And when the time for judgement's at hand,
Don't fret.
He's strong
He'll make a stand
'Gainst evil
The fire that spreads through the land,
He has the power to make it all end.

There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
There's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late

Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin 'round and come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again

Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning out spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns.

Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving, goin' again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.

Kill for gain or shoot to maim
We don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
The shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death

The killer's breed or the demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for our soul anymore

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.

The blind men shout,
"Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers."
Napalm screams of human flames
For a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.

The killer's breed or the demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for our soul anymore

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.

The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.

Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night

Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night

As a young boy chasing Dragons
with your wooden sword so mighty,
You're St. George or you're David and you always
killed the beast
Times change very quickly
And you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet

[Chorus:]
You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no-one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his Honour.

The smell of resined leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the
fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil man.

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no-one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his Honour.

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no-one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his Honour.

He threw down a glove you made the mistake
Of picking it up now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is gone
He'll tear you apart as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance

Oh, oh. Fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for the pleasure
Oh, oh. Fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for your life!

Ready to start the duel begins
The best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow

The fighting resumes, a silence looms
The swordsmen move 'gainst each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
A stab to the heart and you're down
The angel of death hears your last breath
Meanwhile the reaper looks on

Oh, oh. Fought for the honour
Fought for the splendour
Fought for the pleasure
Oh, oh. Fought for the honour
Fought for the splendour
Fought to the death

Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn

White flags shot to ribbons,
The truce is black and burned.
Shell-shock in the kitchen.
Tables overturned

Back in the village again
In the village,
I'm back in the village again.

Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way,
In a black hole and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away.

Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shell-shock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn.

Back in the village again
In the village,
I'm back in the village again.

No breaks on the inside,
Paper cats and burning barns,
There's fox among the chickens,
And a killer in the hounds.

Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shell-shock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn.

Back in the village again
In the village,
I'm back in the village again.

But still we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number, I'm a name!

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Back in the village again
In the village

I'm back in the village
Back in the village
Back in the village again.

Into the Abyss I'll fall - the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night - watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows -
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris - risen again.

[Chorus:]
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
All around is laid waste,
And in my last hour,
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death.

When I was living this lie - Fear was my Game
People would worship and fall -
Drop to their knees.
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me,
For he is a man and a God -
And He will die too.

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
All around is laid waste,
And in my last hour,
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death.

Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,
Silent the terror that reigned -
Marbled in stone
A Shell of a man God preserved -
For thousand ages,
But open the gates of my hell -
I'll strike from the grave

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
All around is laid waste,
And in my last hour,
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death.
Slave to the Power of Death...
Slave to the Power of Death...

Hear the rime of the Ancient Mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares
of the Sea

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and
the Mariner tells his tale.

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name,
hoping good luck it brings.

And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and ice and
the albatross follows on

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.

Sailing on and on and North across the sea
Sailing on and on and North 'till all is calm

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me

"Day after day, day after day,
we stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."

There, calls the mariner
there comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind
in her sails and no tide.

See... onward she comes
Onwards she nears, out of the sun
See... she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two

Death and she Life in Death,
they throw their dice for the crew
She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then ... crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She... She, Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one.

"One after one by the star dogged moon,
too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
and cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
(and I heard nor sigh nor groan),
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
they dropped down one by one."

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The Mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the Sea
Then down in falls comes the rain.

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak
and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and
the Mariner's left alone

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The Pilot's boat, his son and the hermit
Penance of life will fall onto Him.

And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins

The Mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell his tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.

If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Can I tempt you come with me
Be Devil may care fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go would you be scared

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Don't be afraid you're safe with me
Safe as any soul can be... honestly
Just let yourself go

[Chorus:]
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh

Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You try to hide your deepest sins
Of all the things that you've done wrong
And I know where you belong

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Make you an offer you can't refuse
You've only got your soul to lose...
Eternally... let yourself go!

[Chorus:]
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught now in two minds!

From the coast of gold, across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on, far and wide
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but
someone else

I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it 'til it's
gone away
And my heart is lying there and will be 'til my
dying day

[Chorus:]
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for
those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say it's hard to
make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry and throw my
hands up to the sky

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for
those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

[Chorus:]
Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness

Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling
Out in the dark there burns a dream
You got to hope when you are falling
To find the world that you have seen
Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness

It's madness
The sun don't shine
On the sea of madness
There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness when all you see can only bring you sadness
On towards the sea we go...

Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness

Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this
way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be the Angel of Death has come for me
I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away

[Chorus:]
Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait 'til another day

I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying
I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the lights eternal rays
I see a tunnel I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare

Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait 'til another day

Take my hand I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth the path for you is decided

My body tingles I feel so strange
I feel so tired I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait 'til another day

The tough of the track
With the wind
And the rain that's beating down on
Your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more 'til the
Sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread
And every breath you take
Determination
Makes you run never stop
Got to win got to run 'til you drop
Keep the pace hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over half way there
But the miles they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream
Not getting anywhere
It seems so futile

[Chorus]
Run on and on
Run on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at
All costs
I've got to keep going be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on

Run over stiles across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer but do
You want the glory that goes
You reach the final stretch
Ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

Run on and on
Run on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hope and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and
nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
No brave new world, no brave new world

Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home
discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

[Chorus:]
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

One hundred years have gone and men again
they came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell all that day
Preserved in time for all to see
No brave new world, no brave new world
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?

When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?

'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu

[Chorus:]
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before

Ever had a conversation
That you realise you've had before
Isn't it strange

Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next
It feels pre-arranged

'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu

Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before

"My son ask for thyself another
Kingdom, for that which I leave
is too small for thee"

Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend his name was Alexander

At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegian Sea
In 334 B.C.
He utterly beat the armies of Persia

[Chorus:]
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men

King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria

By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis the capital of Persia

[Chorus:]
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a God amongst mortal men

A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia

Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity

Marching on, marching on
The battle weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins

Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

I am he, the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude

Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth-strangled babe
Be the Devil's own, Lucifer's my name

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal

I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones. I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned

And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon, child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight

The twins. They are exhausted. Seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die

One more dies and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give

A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you, young man
But I see you damned in endless night

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon, child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight

Infinite dreams I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams

Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing I cannot move
Standing rigid a nightmare's statue
What a dream when will it end
And will it transcend?

Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep.

Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder it makes me think
There's more to this I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualists? Well me I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth?
Oh what's out there to have the proof
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?

Help me. Help me to find my true
Self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing
Myself even within my dreams

There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again.

Can I play with madness?

Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place

[Chorus]
Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to see

Said you're too blind to see

I screamed aloud to the old man
I said don't lie, don't say you don't know
I say you'll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said you wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire

Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to see


Listen to me, said the prophet

Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to see

Can I play with madness?

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her.
I will call her name out loud.
I would bleed for her.
If I could only see her now.

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge on...
Balancing on a ledge on...
Balancing on a ledge on...
Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge you know ... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on !....
The evil that men do lives on and on !....
The evil that men do lives on and on !....
The evil that men do lives on and on !....

Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me.
And I will pray for you.
...Some day I may return.
Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn.

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge you know... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on!
The evil that men do lives on and on !....
The evil that men do lives on and on !....
The evil that men do lives on and on !....

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge you know ... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on!
The evil that men do lives on and on !....
The evil that men do lives on and on !....
The evil that men do lives on and on !....
The evil !
The evil !
The evil that men do...
The evil !
The evil !
The evil that men do...
Yeah yeah!!

Here they stand brothers them all
All the sons divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one.

Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds

[Chorus:]
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the evil which path will he take
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers before it's too late

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done

Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me
Is it so hard to understand
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends

Suffering and pain impending disaster
Souls crying the devil's laughter
Heard the cry of the seventh whistlers
Lucifer smiles looks on and waits

I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate your fortune's in my visions
Heed what I say and you'll see what
What will be
Please listen to me

Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame unto me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment
It stays with me knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed

Purgatory beckons souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs hell awaits

I had their lives in my hands
Their fates their fortunes in my visions
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late.

Feel the sweat break on my brow.
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
Is this dream or is it now?
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyes?

I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems the powers getting stronger every day.
I feel a strength an inner fire,
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore.

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker.
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying?

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker.
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying?

Just by looking through your eyes,
He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind,
See the truth and see your lies,
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise.

There's time to live and time to die.
When it's time to meet the maker.
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying?

There's time to live and time to die.
When it's time to meet the maker.
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying?

And be reborn again.

The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed

Time it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
Time it waits for no man
My fate is sealed

If I cancel tomorrow the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of the prophets I mock your morality plays

The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an end game, one more stalemate

Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us?
And look through our eyes?

Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin does is measure up to your lust?

So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell

Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

Trace your way back 50 years
To the Glow of Dresden, blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight
Yeah!

Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to whet the blood thirst
No radar lock on, skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home

Climb into the sky
Never wonder why
Tailgunner
You're a tailgunner

Climb into the sky
Never wonder why
Tailgunner
You're a tailgunner

Climb into the sky
Never wonder why
Tailgunner
You're a tailgunner

Climb into the sky
Never wonder why
Tailgunner
You're a tailgunner

Nail that Fokker kill that son
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun
The weather forecast's good for war
Cologne and Frankfurt? Have some more!

Tail-end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this tailgunner's gone
No more bombers, one big bomb

Climb into the sky
Never wonder why
Tailgunner
You're a tailgunner

Climb into the sky
Never wonder why
Tailgunner
You're a tailgunner

Climb into the sky
Never wonder why
Tailgunner
You're a tailgunner

Climb into the sky
Never wonder why
Tailgunner
You're a tailgunner

Believe in me and send no money
I died on the cross, that ain't funny
But my so called friends are making me a joke
They missed out what I said like I never spoke

They choose what they wanna hear, they don't tell a lie
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
Saving your souls by taking your money
Flies round shit, bees around honey

Holy smoke, Holy smoke
Plenty bad preachers for the Devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making Holy smoke

Making Holy smoke

Jimmy Reptile and all his friends
Say they're gonna be with you at the end
Burning records, burning books
Holy soldiers, Nazi looks

Crocodile smiles, just wait a while
'Til the TV Queen gets her make up clean
I've lived in filth, I've lived in sin
And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in

Holy smoke, Holy smoke
These plenty bad preachers for the Devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making Holy smoke

Holy smoke
Smells good

They ain't religious but they ain't no fools
When Noah built his Cadillac, it was cool
Two by two, they're still going down
And the satellite circus just left town

I think they're strange and when they're dead
They can have a Lincoln for their bed
Friend of the president, trick of the tail
Now they ain't got a prayer, 100 years in jail

Holy smoke, Holy smoke
Plenty bad preachers for the Devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making Holy smoke

Holy smoke

There are times when I've wondered
And times when I've cried
When my prayers they were answered
At times when I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you the truth
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose

When I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end

God give me the answer to my life
God give me the answer to my dreams
God give me the answer to my prayers
God give me the answer to my being

When it all comes down the line,
And the lights they turn to greed
And you race off with your tires screaming
Rolling thunder,

And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got your fast bullet,
One way ticket out of here

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In the cities in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and riots

The politicians gamble
And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed the scapegoats
Public enema number one

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell ya

Your children have more brains
Than your drug-infested remains
California dreaming
As the Earth dies screaming

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive
And some of us are here just so that we'll die
How come the bullet hits the other guy
Do we have to try and reason why

Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

Are we the lucky ones saved for another day
Or they the lucky ones who are taken away
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above
Or the Devil himself come to give you a shove.

Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away
A hurricane devastates the cities in its way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
The worst is yet to come a hell to face mankind

Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

Now the contracts out
They've put the word about
I'm coming after you

It's not the money I make
It's the thrill of the chase
And I'm coming after you

I watch your every move
Study the things you do
And the pattern of your ways

I watch the way you walk
I hear your telephone talk
I want to understand the way you think

[Chorus]
Better watch out, cos I'm the Assassin
Better watch out, Better watch out
Assassin

I'm in a cold cold sweat
I taste the smell of death
I know the moment's getting closer

And as you walk to the light
I feel my hands go tight
Excitement running through my veins

I've got you in my sights
I've got you dead to rights
The triggers waiting for my finger

I feel adrenalin rush
It's just the final touch
You can kiss your arse goodbye

Better watch out, cos I'm the Assassin
Better watch out, Better watch out
Assassin

The convoy lights are dead ahead
The merchantmen lay in their bed,
The trump of diesels hammers down,
In the oily sea - the killing ground,

Knuckles white, eyes alight,
He slams the hatch on the deadly night,
A cunning fox in the chickens lair
A hound of hell and the devil don't care

Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer,
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below,
Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep

Chill the hearts of fighting men,
In open ocean wondering when
The lethal silver fish will fly
This boat will shiver, men will die

A cast of millions, a part of play
Killer? Victim? Or fool for a day
Obeying an order, men have to die
Us or them, a well-rehearsed lie

Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer,
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below,
Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep

The lifeboats shattered, the hull is torn,
The tar black smell of burning oil,
On the way down to Davy Jones,
Every man for himself, you're on your own

The wolf eyes watch the crosswire
"Stern tubes ready", "Aim and fire!"
They can pin some medal on your chest,
But in two more weeks, dead like the rest

Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer,
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below,
Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep

I got the keys to view at number 22
Behind my green door there's nothing to see
Is that a feature, what kind of creature
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me

Stone-cold sober and sitting in silence
Laid back, looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

She's tied up, she can't come to the phone
You must have got your wires crossed 'cause she ain't home
Knock on wood, you know I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you

Right on the money, got it wrapped up tight
Got new ideas for the decor tonight
Make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete, set her up on her own

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
I've got those ...hooks in you

Honey it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow, make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
Unchain your back door, invite me around

Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Honey it's getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
'Cause you know, you know I'm coming soon

So pick up your foolish pride, no going back
No where, no way, no place to hide

Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Mother Russia how are you sleeping
Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling round like ghosts in the snow

Mother Russia poetry majestic
Tells the time of a great empire
Turning round the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by

Mother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Be proud of what you are
Now it has come
Freedom at last
Turning the tides of history
And your past

Mother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Remember who you are
Can you release
The anger the grief
Can you be happy
Now your people are free

Covered in sinners and dripping with gilt
Making you money from slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers

You got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head....

Be quick !
Or be dead !
Be quick !
Or be dead

See... what's ruling all our lives
See... who pulling the strings...
See... what's ruling all our lives
See... who pulls the strings...

I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place

The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says must vote for what you want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright
Pull yourself stupid, rob yourself blind.

You got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head....

Be quick!
Or be dead!
Be quick!
Or be dead!

She fell in love with his greasy machine
She leaned over wiped his kickstart clean
She'd never seen the beast before
But she left there wanting more more more

But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
"I'll take you on ride from here to eternity"

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity


She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
I've made her feel like she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sigh.

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the devil's bend
The beast and Charlotte they were two of a kind
They'd always take the line... from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not fear 'cos I'd rather go now
Trying to visualise the horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground

When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime ?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die

God let us go now and finish what's to be done
Thy Kingdom come
Thy shall be done... on earth

Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgive

But how can we let them go on this way ?
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down there's no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers.

We live our lives in fever
In choking sweat of fear
In the heat of the night you can feel so much
In the heat of the night I scream "Don't touch"

[Chorus:]
I remember a time when we used and abused
And we fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night... bodies aflame

We live in fever...

I hear your secret heartbeat
I can hear your silent cries
The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares till somebody famous dies...

I remember a time when we used and abused
And we fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night... bodies aflame

Now we live, in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key - to what you want to be
You don't get a say the majority gets it's way
You're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die...

I'd sail across the ocean
I'd walk a hundred miles
If I could make it to the end
Oh just to see a smile

You see it in their faces
The sadness in their tears
The desperation and the anger
Madness and the fear

[Chorus:]
No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, just greed is here

Starvation and the hunger
The suffering and the pain
The agonies of all-out war
When will it come again ?

The struggle for the power
A tyrant tries again
Just what the hell is going on ?
When will it ever end ?

[Chorus:]

You see the full moon float
You watch the red sun rise
We take these things for granted
But somewhere someone's dying

Contaminated waters
Pollution and decay
Just waiting for disease to strike
Oh will we learn someday ?

No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, no seed, childhood's end.

Maybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up 'til now I'm doing the best I can
Long roads. Long days of sunrise to sunset
Of sunrise to sunset

Dream on brothers while you can
Dream on sisters I hope you will find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly by the tides of time

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night

Dream on brothers while you can
Dream on sisters I hope you will find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly by the tides of time

Sands are flowing and the lines are in your hand
In your eyes I see the hunger, and the desperate cry that tears the night

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night

On a cold October morning
As frost lay on the ground
Waiting to make my move
I made no sound

Waiting for the mist to cover all around
I carefully picked my time then took the wall

I'm sick and tired of running
The hunger and the pain
A stop to look about then off again

Being at the wrong place
And at the wrong time
Suspected of a hit that was my crime

I am a fugitive being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name

Always looking 'round me
Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack

Every morning onwards
Always on the run
Waiting for a sight of a loaded gun

I am a fugitive being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name

Even if I find them
And get to clear my name
I know that things can never be the same

But if I ever prove
My innocence some day
I've got to get them all to make them pay

I am a fugitive being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name

There's a madman in the corner of your eye
He likes to pry into your sunlight
He wants to burst into the street with you and I
A world of shadows and of rain

He's seen what love is...
He wants to pay you back with guilt...

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still 'til he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery

There's a prophet in the gutter in the street
He says, "You're damned!" and you believe him...
He's got a vision but it shines out through your eyes
A world of hatred and fear...

He's felt what love means...
He wants to pay you back with pain

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still 'til he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still 'til he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery

It's only love that holds the key to your hearts... only love...
It's only love

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still 'til he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still 'til he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery

Now I'm here can you see me
'Cos I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold tell me you can feel me
..........'cos I'm here

Here I am, can you see me
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to only in my dreams... before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'Cause you can count your real true friends on one hand
..........through life

There are those that deceive you
There are those That'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would die for you
..........thought not

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
..........so they say

In a world of confusion
People never say that what they mean
If you want a straight answer go look for one
..........right now

In a room full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall
Do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside
..........looking in ?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power if you want to
..........it's true

You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
..........it does

Are we here for a reason ?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what happened when we die
..........wouldn't it ?

There are some who are wise
There are some who are born naive
I believe that there are some that must have lived before
..........don't you ?

As for me, well I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not an open and shut case.

Extra Sensory Perception
Life After Death, telepathy
Can the soul live on and travel through space and time ?

You know I feel so elated
'Cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
..........to fill you in

You don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around ...it's me

And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your `friends' might say
We'll meet up again some place some way
..........one day

Lights out
We live in a world of darkness
No doubt
Everything's up for sale

We sleep
All of the world is burning
We pray to god for a better deal

Nothing is sacred back then or now
Everything's wasted
Is that all there is?
Can I go now?

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

Fight wars, die in a blaze of glory
Come home, meat in a plastic sack
Fall down
Better pray to your god for mercy
So kneel and help the blade cut clean

Nothing is sacred back then or now
Everyone's wasted
Is that all there is?
Is that it now?

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

I live in the black
I have no guiding light
I'm whispering in your dreams

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool
Who are you kidding being that cool ?

Trying to break away from running with the pack
But they ain't listening so you've gotta go back

You're a weekend warrior when you're one of the crowd
But it's over, just look at you now...

You're not so brave the way you behave
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick
It's all bravado when you're out with your mates
It's like a different person goes through those gates
And the game begins, the adrenalin's high
Feel the tension maybe someone will die...

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore

You've gotta get out gotta get away
But you're in with a clique it's not easy to stray
You've gotta admit you're just living a lie
It didn't take long to workout why

It's hard to say why you got involved
Just waiting to be part, just waiting to belong...

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore

Some of the things that you've done you feel so ashamed
After all it's only a game... isn't it ?
And after all the adrenalin's gone
What you gonna do on Monday ?

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you were never like that at all.

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

The ferryman wants his money you ain't going to give it back
He can push his own boat as you set up off the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son,
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so,
Nothing's real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home

Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your souls to this brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

Dying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back home

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burned

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

There are time when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad

Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life....

Pay to kill, die to lose, hunted, hunter which are you
Diablo come again to make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull, one by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate, know which breath will be your last

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Human heart, human mind, intellect intertwined
Focus sharp in the night, watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe throw the line, everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will iron fist, how could it have come to this?

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Have you ever felt the future is the past, but you don't know how...?
A reflected dream of a captured time, is it really now, is it really happening?

Don't know why I feel this way, have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

Think I've heard your voice before, think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation
Coming to the realization that I can't see for sure

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, please save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

I get up put on the light, dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate, nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

Dread to think what might be stirring, that my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away from drifting, saving me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

Lost in a dream of mirrors, lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning, lost a nightmare I retrace
Lost a hell that I revisit, lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence, lost a nightmare I retrace

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a devil to get ready and take over your mind

You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the only one
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Beaten fallen angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day

You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the only one
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know that I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of my world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face all this on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
Your are the keeper of the mystery in your hands

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what you future will behold
You're a legend you own story will be told

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Withered hands, withered bodies begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty, the punishment is death for all who live
The punishment is death for all who live

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

The killing fields, the grinding wheels crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives no more disguise, no more second chances
Haggard wisdom spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you before you know the crime it's all too late
Before you know the crime it's all too late

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

When a person turns to wrong, is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any cost, at what price a life is lost

At what point do we begin, fighter spirit a will to win
But what makes a man decide, take the wrong or righteous road

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings

Sometimes take just more than that to survive be good at heart
There is evil in some of us no matter what will never change

I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane

At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

The thin line between love and hate

The thin line between love and hate

I'm gonna organize some changes in my life
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go

And I just feel I can be anything
That all I might ever wish to be
And fantasize just what I want to be
Make my wildest dreams come true

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
Out on the road again

When I remember back to how that things just used to be
And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery
I felt I'd disappeared so deep inside myself
I couldn't find a way to break away my hell

When I'm feeling down and low
I vow I'll never be the same again
I just remember what I am
And visualize just what I'm gonna be

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
Out on the road again

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
I'm gonna breakaway

When I was wandering in the desert
And was searching for the truth
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
I turned my face towards the barren sun

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground
They are sealed and are now washed away

You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears.....

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and now far away

You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears.....

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and now far away

There's a darkened sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a last horizon
But no regrets from me

Maybe I'll be back some other day
To live again just who can say
In what shape or form that I might be
Just another chance for me

A hurried time no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all my life away
No-one can stop me now

Time is up it couldn't last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Someday maybe I'll wait till then

No more lies...

They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet

So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you

The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is everclear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home

No more lies...

A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusions
And wishing all your life away
No-one can stop me now

Time is up it couldn't last
But there's more things I have to do
I'm coming back to try again
Don't tell me that this is the end

No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...

They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet

So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you

The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is everclear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home

No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...

A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusions
And wishing all your life away
No-one can stop me now

Time is up it couldn't last
But there's more things I have to do
I'm coming back to try again
Don't tell me that this is the end

No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...
No more lies...

I stand alone in this desolate space
In death they are truly alive
Massacred innocence, evil took place
The angels were burning inside

Centuries later I wonder why
What secret they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion's still burning inside

At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross

Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on demand
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the cathars, to die and be free

The book of Old Testament crippled and black
Satan - his weapon is lust
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of lies

The perfect ones willingly died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed
Religion's still burning inside

[Repeat chorus, 3rd verse]
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross

Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
Still burning heretics under our skies

As we kill them all so God know his own
Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust
The eye in the triangle smiling with sin
No passover feast for the cursed within

Facing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the cathars and to die and be free

At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the everglades
I'd one drink but no more

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace

Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals

And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them
They had ascended from hell

As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead

Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me

By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled

I ran like hell faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead

When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Drink and say a prayer for it

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead

Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights

To the women and children, the souls of the dead
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this, if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on

Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this, if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on

Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow

Bleeding you dry from the start
The sum of my parts
To give it away
New life in a day
Some new Frankenstein
Damned for all time

Cursed by the angel who fell
Who saves me from hell?
And who is my god?
And where is my soul?
Too tired to jump too young to run

[Bridge:]
Neverending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start

[Chorus:]
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing god without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk - a war of god and man?
Is it worth the risk - a war of god and man?

I want to end my life now
But I don't know how
Recycled again a lifetime of pain
The spawn of a man
The devil has planned

Neverending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start

Out beyond the new frontier
Playing god without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk - a war of god and man?
Is it worth the risk - a war of god and man?

In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale

Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years

Laying low in a blood filled trench
Kill time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to god no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale

Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go

Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale

Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale

Everybody's waiting for something to happen
Everybody's waiting for something to see
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters
Everyone's waiting for news on TV

Winding lives at the end of the spiral
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill
Everyone's looking, but no one is listening
Everybody wants to be in at the kill

I wait for the signs, they tell me true
I see the signs of the end of time

Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing
Everyone's looking for the reason why
Everyone's hoping for life everafter
Everyone's looking at death from the sky

Everyone's nightmares are going to happen
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes
Everyone's praying but no one's believing
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies

I wait for the signs, they tell me true
I see the signs of the end

So I watch and I wait
And I pray for an answer
An end to the strife and the world's misery
But the end never came
And we're digging the graves
And we're loading the guns for the kill

Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand
Future memory of our tragedy?
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand
Future memory of our tragedy?

So I watch and I wait
And I pray for an answer
An end to the strife and the world's misery
But the end never came
And we're digging the graves
And we're loading the guns for the kill

Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand
Future memory of our tragedy?
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand
Future memory of our tragedy?

I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all

And all the politicians and their hollow promises
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
The working man pays everything for their mistakes
And with his life too if there was to be a war

So we only get one chance, can we take it?
And we only get one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream

A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
The victims' mind are scarred for life most everyday
Assailants know just how much further they can go
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low

So we only get one chance, can we take it?
And we only get one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream

You can't protect yourselves even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries, the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminal they launch right in our face
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace

Despondent public worries, where it will all end?
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend
We cannot even warn each other of evil in our midst
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

So we only get one chance, can we take it?
And we only get one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream

From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death
And he has cheated us

But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping
And we'll dream for evermore

And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows we made with our hands
Deep grey, came to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?

[Chorus:]
I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away

But the memory still remains
All the past years not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around

In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then the journeyman's day has begun

I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away

In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then the journeyman's day has begun

I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away

You lead me on the path
Keep showing me the way
I feel a little lost
A little strange today

I think I'll take a hold
Of whatever comes my way
Then we'll see what happens
Take it day by day

I though I had it all
I had it all worked out
Just what my future held
That there would be no doubt

But then the card came up
And I took another turn
But I don't know if it's
Fulfillment that I yearn

Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world

I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn

Don't want to be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I might find it's not for me

Don't know what I want
Or where I want to be
I'm feeling more confused
The more the days go by

It's the same in every country
When you say you're leaving
Left behind the loved ones
Waiting silent in the hall
Where you're going lies adventure
others only dream of
Red and green light this is real
and so you go to war

For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
What's the difference, all the same

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war

Here is no one that will save you
Going down in flames
No surrender certain death
You look it in the eye
On the shores of tyranny you

Crashed the human wave
Paying for my freedom with your
Lonely unmarked graves

For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
What's the difference, all the same

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war

We are not the sons of God
We are not his chosen people now
We have crossed the path he trod
We will feel the pain of his beginning

Shadow fingers rise above
Iron fingers stab the desert sky
Oh Behold the power of man
On its tower ready for the fall

Knocking heads together well
Rise a city build a living hell
Join the race to suicide
Listen for the tolling of the bell

Out of the universe a strange love is born
Unholy union trinity reformed

Yellow sun it's evil twin
In the black the wings deliver him
We will split our souls within
Atom seed to nuclear dust is riven

Out of the universe a strange love is born
Unholy union, trinity reformed

Out of the darkness
Brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness
Brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness
Brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness
Brighter than a thousand suns

Bury your morals and bury your dead
Bury your head in the sand
E=mc squared you can relate
how we made God
With our hands

Whatever would Robert have said to his God
About how we made war with the sun
E=mc squared you can relate
how we made God
With our hands

All the nations are rising
Through acid veils of love and hate
Chain letters of Satan
Uncertainty leads us all to this
All the nations are rising
Through acid veils of love and hate
Cold fusion and fury

Divide and conquer while ye may
Others preach and others fall and pray
In the bunkers where we'll die
Where the executioners they lie

Bombers launch with no recall
Minutes warning of the missile fall
Take a look at your last sky
Guessing you won't have the time to cry

Out of the universe a strange love is born
Unholy union, trinity reformed

Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness
Brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness
Brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness
Brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness
Brighter than a thousand suns

Holy Father we have sinned

The keys to death and hell
The ailing kingdom doomed to fall
The bonds of sin and heart will break
The pilgrims course will take

Quelling the devils might
And ready for eternal fight
Aching limbs and fainting soul
Holy battles take their toll

Liberty and hope divine
Changing water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hell

Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun

To courage find and gracious will
Deliver good from ill
Clean the water clean our guilt
With us do what you will

Then will my judge appear
Bear no false angel that I hear
For only then I will confess
To my eternal hell

Now give us our holy sign
Changing water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hell

Spirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begun

In the gloom the gathering storm abates
In the ships gimlet eyes await
The call to arms to hammer at the gates
To blow them wide throw evil to its fate

All summers long the drills to build the machine
To turn man from flesh and blood to steel
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach
From summer sends to Armageddon's reach

Overlord your master not your god
The enemy coast dawning grey with scud
These wretched souls puking shaking fear
To take a bullet for those who send them here

The world's all right the cliffs erupt in flame
No escape remorseless shrapnel rains
Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate
A choking death enter hell's gates

Sliding we go only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire
And we rush with the tide
Oh the water is red
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive pray to God I survive

How long on this longest day
'Till we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Till we finally make it through

The rising dead faces bloated torn
They are relieved the living wait their turn
Your number's up the bullet's got your name
You still go on to hell and back again

Valhalla waits Valkyries rise and fall
The warrior tombs lie open for us all
A ghostly hand reaches through the wall
Blood and sand we will prevail

Sliding we go only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire
And we rush with the tide
Oh the water is red
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive pray to God I survive

How long on this longest day
'Till we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Till we finally make it through

How long on this longest day
'Till we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Till we finally make it through

Hold a halo round the world
Golden is the day
Princess of the Universe
Your burden is the way
So there is no better time
Who will be born today
A gypsy child at day break
A king for a day

Out of the Shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Dusty dreams in fading daylight
Flicker on the walls
Nothing new your life's adrift
What purpose to it all?
Eyes are closed and death is calling
Reaching out its hand
Call upon the starlight to surround you

Out of the Shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Out of the Shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Out of the Shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Out of the Shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

A man who casts no shadow has no soul

Let me tell you about my life
Let me tell you about my dreams
Let me tell you about the things that happen
Always real to me

Let me tell you of my hope
Of my need to reach the sky
Let me take you on an awkward journey
Let me tell you why
Let me tell you why

Why should these curses be laid upon me
I won't be forgiven 'till I can break free
What did I do to deserve all this guilt
Pay for my sins with the sale of my soul
Demons are trapped all inside of my head
My hopes are gone reach for heaven from hell

My sins are many my guilt is too heavy
The pressure of knowing of hiding what I know
I'm able to see things
Things I don't want to see
The lives of a thousand souls
Weigh heavy down on me

I know they're crying for help reaching out
The burden of them will take me down as well
The sin of a thousand souls not died in vain
Reincarnate still in me live again

Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring the salvation
To exorcise this hell

Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring the salvation
To exorcise this hell

Someone to save me
Something to save me from my hell
A destination
Away from this nightmare

Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring the salvation
To exorcise this hell

Are you a man of peace
Or man of holy war
Too many sides to you
Don't know which any more
So many full of life
But also filled with pain
Don't know just how many
Will live to breathe again

A life that's made to breath
Destruction or defense
A mind that's vain corruption
Bad or good intent
A wolf in a sheep's clothing
Or saintly or sinner
Or someone that would believe
A holy war winner

They fire off many shots
And many parting blows
Their actions beyond a reasoning
Only god would know
And as he lies in heaven
Or it could be in hell
I feel he's somewhere here
Or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't know

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

More pain and misery in the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like the blind leading the blind
It brings upon us more of famine death and war
You know religion has a lot to answer for

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

And as they search to find the bodies in the sand
They find it's ashes that are scattered across the land
And as their spirits seem to whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere another war begins

And all because of it you'd think that we would learn
But still the body count the city fires burn
Somewhere there's someone dying in a foreign land
Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man
Tell me why, tell me why

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

For the greater good of God [x8]

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

For the greater good of God [x8]

He gave his life for us he fell upon the cross
To die for all of those who never mourn his loss
It wasn't meant for us to feel the pain again
Tell me why, tell me why

There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you tell to me alone
I can't reach things I can't see
You don't see this strange world
Quite the same as me
Don't deny me what I am
Nothing hidden still you fail to see the truth
These are things you can't reveal
These are things you can't reveal

We are part of some strange plan
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man
Infernal sacrifice of hell
Fire breathing lead the way
Mounds of bodies as they all burn into one
Revenge is living in the past
Time to look into a new millennium

Spiral path leads through the maze
Down into the fiery underworld below
Fire breathing lead the way
Lucifer was just an angel led astray

Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries

Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries

We are not worthy in your black and blazing eyes
We gather demons in the mirror every day
The bridge of darkness casts a shadow on us all
And all our sins to you we give this day

Others wait their turn their lives were meant to last
Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast
Free your soul and let it fly
Mine was caught I couldn't try
Time returns again to punish all of us

We are cast out by our bloody fathers hand
We are strangers in this lonely promised land
We are shadows of the one unholy ghost
In our nightmare world the only one we trust

Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries

Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries

Tell you a thing
That you ought to know
Two minutes of your time
Then on you go

Tell tale of the man
All dressed in black
That most of them
Not coming back

Sent off to war
To play little games
And on their return
Can't name no names

Some strange yellow gas
Has played with their minds
Has reddened their eyes
Removed all the lies

And strange as it sounds
Death knows no bounds
How many get well
Only time will tell
Only time will tell

You lie in your death bed now
But what did you bring to the table
Brought us only holy sin
Utter trust is a deadly thing

To the prayer of holy peace
We didn't know what was lying underneath
So how could we be such fools
And to think that we thought you knew the answer

I can't begin to understand in all the lies
But on your death bed I can see it in your eyes
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
It really makes sense I can see it clearly now

Tangled up in a web of lies
Could have been a way to prophecies
Unaware of the consequence
Not aware of the secrets that you kept

Nothing that we could believe
To reveal the facade of faceless men
Not a thing that we could foresee
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome

You had us all strung out with promises of peace
But all along your cover plan was to deceive
Can it be put to rights now only time will tell
Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well

Left to all our golden sons
All to pick up on the peace
You could have given all of them
A little chance...at least

Take the world to a better place
Given them all just a little hope
Just think what a legacy
You now...will leave

We seem destined to live in fear
And some that would say Armageddon is near
But where there's a life while there's hope
That man won't self destruct

Why can't we treat our fellow men
With more respect and a shake of their hands
But anger and loathing is rife
The death on all sides is becoming a way of life

We live in an uncertain world
Fear understanding and ignorance is leading to death
Only the corpses are left
For vultures that prey on their bones

But some are just not wanting peace
Their whole life is death and misery
The only thing that they know
Fight fire with fire life is cheap

But if they do stop to think
That man is teetering right on the brink
But do you think that they care
They benefit from death and pain and despair

I try to call the Earth's command
Desperation in my voice
I'm drifting way off course now
With very little choice

The loneliness is hard to bear
I try to calm my fear
Just hoping any second now
Some contact filters through

Desperate calls...
Signal back from Satellite
As my life flashes right in front of me

Try again...must get through
Hear me now...
For I've very little time

Not much time...hear my call
Please get through...I am here

I'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace
I haven't a chance of getting away
Too close to the sun, I surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes
I think of my life, reliving the past
There's nothing but wait 'til my time comes
I've had a good life, I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time, my friends

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

If I could survive to live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Done more in my life than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over again

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
And tell them that one last goodbye

The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

[Guitar solo]

There isn't much time, must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes, if only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them that one last goodbye

The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier

Gotta tell you a story
On a cold winter's night
You'll been sailing for glory
Before you know what is right

So come over here now
I've got a vision for you
It's my personal snake oil
It's just something I do

I'm the Jester with no tears
And I'm playing on your fears
I'm a trickster smiling underneath this mask of love and death
The eternal lie I've told
About the pyramids of gold
I've got you hooked at every turn, your money's left to burn

You'll be wanting a contract. Ha!
You'll be waiting a while
I'd like to keep you my contact
But that isn't my style
Well, you'll only get one chance
And it's too good to miss
If I didn't lie to you
Then I wouldn't exist

Greed, lust, and envy pry
It's the same old same old way
The smoke and mirrors
Visions that you see are just like me
I'm a clever banker's face
With just a little out of place
I know someone just like you knows someone just like me

El Dorado come and play
El Dorado step this way
Take a ticket for the ride

El Dorado streets of gold
See the ship it's oversold
You've got one last chance to try

So gone is the glory
And gone is the gold
Well if you need a story
I'll come, it has to be told

Well you may say I'm a devil
And I wouldn't say no
But out here on the dark side
Hey! On with the show!

So now my tale is told
Big and bad and twice as bold
The ship of fools is sinking as the cracks begin to grow
There is no easy way
For an honest man today
Which is something you should think of as my lifeboat sails away

El Dorado come and play
El Dorado step this way
Take a ticket for the ride

El Dorado streets of gold
See the ship it's oversold
You've got one last chance to try

El Dorado come and play
El Dorado step this way
Take a ticket for the ride

El Dorado streets of gold
See the ship it's oversold
You've got one last chance to try

Sitting waiting in the falling rain
Getting ready to begin again

Wounded lying, crying, bodies moving, dying
All around there is the smell of death and fire

Here the planes are coming
Hear the soldiers running
Killing on a scale to comprehend

Why are we here
In this place...here to kill
Please God forgive us for
What we have done

I always thought I was doing right
As of now I'm not feeling so sure

I'm at a place where
I give no grace
I'm a soldier of war

I sit waiting for my darkest hour to come
I cannot think about the things that I have done
It shouldn't take a fool to see that I believe
Accept the consequence, repent for what I've done

You tell me what is certain but I'll tell you what is true
You tell me what is honesty, when all around is death and cruelty
The making of a man is fire, not giving into our desires
Within the truth it lies within the only thing

Mother of Mercy
Angel of death desire
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy
Angel of pain
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath

Some say you are a lost cause, some say you're a saint
Just being here's an act of suffering and restraint
Walk down the long dark road to ruin and panic not
I'll die a lonely death of
That I'm certain of

Rivers flow with blood there's nowhere left to hide
It's hard to comprehend there's anyone left alive
Sick of all the killing and the reek of death
Will god tell me what religion is to man
I don't hold with bad religion understand what's underneath it
Now I come to think of it, I just don't hold at all you know it
You say you are a holy man, but what is it you do
From where I stand is nothing but a hollow man I see

Mother of Mercy
Angel of death desire
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy
Angel of pain
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath

Mother of Mercy
Angel of death desire
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy
Angel of pain
Mother of mercy
Drawing my last breath

I'm just a lonely soldier fighting in a bloody hopeless war
Don't know what I'm fighting, who it is, or what I'm fighting for
Thought it was for money, make my fortune, now I'm not so sure
Seem to just have lost my way

When I stand before you shining in the early morning sun
When I feel the engines roar and I think of what we've done
Oh the bittersweet reflection as we kiss the earth goodbye
As the waves and echoes of the towns become the ghosts of time

Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
No creed and no religion just a hundred winged souls
We will ride this thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away, our land of birth

To Albion's land
Coming home when I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay

Curving on the edge of daylight til it slips into the void
Waited in the long night, dreaming til the sun is born again
Stretched the fingers of my hand, covered countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite, speck of dust and cosmic sand

Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
Through the dark Atlantic; over mounting stormy waves
We will ride this thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away, our land of birth

To Albion's land
Coming home when I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay

To Albion's land
Coming home when I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay

Coming home, far away when I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay

Stranger than the comet as it streaks across the sky
Stranger than the truth I know before my open eyes
I have dealt in mysteries and trickery, of light to entertain
Looked into the abyss, called it by its name

I have plundered time itself, put the world inside it
And the mysteries, day and night, divide it
A plague of wonders, on your knees beside me
Know the secrets, you shall not deride us

My dreams of empire for my frozen queen
Will come to pass
Know me, the Magus
I am Dr. Dee
And this is my house

I am the master of the tides
I shame the mirror in my sight
What random music of the spheres across the years

Know this I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain of the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame
Hear the master summon up the spirits by their names
I curse you Edward Kelly your betrayal for eternity is damned
Know you speak with demons you cannot command

Even as I looked into the glass then I was blinded
Burning by the Mortlake shore my house my books inside it
You have taken up my wife and lain beside her
Now the black rain on my house, the timbers burning

My dreams of empire for my frozen queen
Will come to pass
Know me, the Magus
I am Dr. Dee
And this was my house

I was the keeper of the books
I had the knowledge of the scrolls
But now through ignorance and fear
I cast a shadow through the years

Know this I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain of the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Know this
I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain of the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Know this
I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Restore the knowledge memory
Strange alchemy

I can hear them floating on the wind
Immortal souls their weeping saddens me
Mother earth you know your time is near
Awaken lust the seed is sown and reaped

Through the western isle I hear the dead awaken
Rising slowing to the court of Avalon
The cauldron of the head of Annwyn laced with envy
Dark around its edge with pearl and destiny

All my days I've waited for the sign
The one that brings me closer to isle of Avalon
I can feel the power flowing through my veins
My heart is beating louder, close to Avalon

I can hear you, can you hear me?
I can feel you, can't you feel me?

Fertility Mother Goddess
Celebration, sow the seeds of the born
The fruit of her body laden
Through the corn doll
You will pray for them all
The image of Mother Goddess
Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
The sheaf of the corn is broken
End the harvest
Throw the dead on the pyre

I hear her crying the tears of an angel
The voices I hear in my head
Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth
Mother earth holy blood of the dead

Mother earth I can hear you
Sacrifice, now united

Rising levels of the tidal lakes protect them
Keepers of the goddess in the underworld
Holding powers of the mystics, deep inside them
nineteen maidens, guardians of the otherworld
Mortal conflict born of Celtic legend
That apart from seven, non-returned from Avalon

Mother earth I can feel you
My rebirth now completed

Fertility mother goddess
Celebration, sow the seeds of the born
The fruits of her body laden
Through the corn doll
You will pray for them all
The image of mother goddess
Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
The sheaf of the corn is broken
End the harvest, throw the dead on the pyre

To have the belief of others
Looking for the Isle to show them a sign
Fertility of all mothers
Stood in silence
Waiting now for their turn

The gateway to Avalon
The island where the souls of the dead are reborn
Brought here to die and be transferred into the earth
And then for rebirth

I hear her crying the tears of an angel
The voices I hear in my head
Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth
Mother earth holy blood of the dead

The water in rivers and rhymes rises quickly
Are flowing and flooding the land
The sea shall return once again just to hide them
Lost souls on the Isle of the dead

Take my eyes the things I've seen in this world coming to an end
My reflection fades, I'm weary of these earthly bones and skin
You may pass through me and leave no trace, I have no mortal face
Solar winds are whispering, you may hear me call

We can shed our skins and swim into the darkened void beyond
We will dance among the world that orbit stars that aren't our sun
All the oxygen that trapped us in a carbon spider's web
Solar winds are whispering, you may hear the sirens of the dead

Left the elders to their parley meant to satisfy our lust
Leaving Damocles still hanging over all their promised trust
Walk away from freedoms offered by their jailers in their cage
Step into the light startripping over mortals in their rage

Starblind - with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night

Starblind - with sun
The stars are one
We are, with the Goddess of the sun tonight

The preacher loses face with Christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hallow bones
Make pacts of love but die alone

The crucible of pain will forge
The blanks of sin, begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose

Virgins in the teeth of God are meat and drink to feed the damned
You may pass through me and I will feel the life that you live less
Step into my light startripping, we will rage against the night
Walk away from comfort offered by your citizens of death

Starblind - with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night

Starblind - with sun
The stars are one
We're one with the goddess of the sun tonight

Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose whatever
Life to live or life to lose

Whatever God, you know
He knows you, better than you believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived

Look into our face reflected in the moon glow in your eyes
Remember you can choose to look but not to see and waste your hours
You believe you have the time but I tell you your time is short
See your past and future all the same and it cannot be bought

Starblind - with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night

Starblind - with sun
The stars are one
We're one with the Goddess of the sun tonight

Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose whatever
Life to live or life to lose

Whatever God you know
He knows you better than you believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived

The preacher loses face with Christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hollow bones
Make pacts of love but die alone

The crucible of pain will forge
The blanks of sin, begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose

When I stand and look about the port
And contemplate my life,
Will I ever see my countrymen again?

As the captain calls us on the deck
I take my things and walk to the harbourside,
I glance back one last time

Fleeing our nation,
Our problems we leave behind
Ships by the tenfold
Sail out on the tide
We are pleased to be out and
Embracing the open sea
Free from our troubles
And more free from thee

Inheritors unfulfilled reason
Behind us.
We flee from what is not what
Is will be.
We flee the earth and face our
Harsh reality.
Will death be low mist that
Hangs on the sea?

We run from the evil tongues,
Rash judgements, selfish men
Never to be seen on these shores again.

As we sail into oceansize
And lose sight of all land
A face of contentment
Around in the air
We're off now to seek all our fortunes
To the land of our dreams

Riding the waves and the storm
Is upon us.
The winds lash the sails but
The ropes keep them tight

Off in the distance a dark cloud approaching
None could imagine what there was to come

No, there's no one going back
No, there's not a second chance
As we strap onto the side
We pray to God that we won't die

As we ride the rough seas,
As we soak from the ocean waves,
I just hope for all our lives
And pray that I survive

Four ships are lost in the
Stormy conditions
The spirits of the sunken crews,
Their phantoms follow us

Spirits, sails, they drive us on
Through the all consuming waves
Cold mortality, no weapon
Against these ever raging seas

Four leagues and ten and we
Hit storms again
We just can't get away from
The eye of the storm

The birds outsoar the raging storm
But we cannot escape it
Abandoned earth that we now crave
Is many leagues from safe

Holding on for our dear lives
And we're praying once again
rotten luck or just jonahed?
The talisman is in my hand

Limbs fatigues, trembling with cold
Blinded from the sea spray salt
Clasping anything we can hold
Heaven's rain upon us falls

Twenty days without a meal
And ten without fresh water still
Those that didn't die in storms
The scurvy rest did slaughter

Westwards the tide
westwards we sail on
Westwards the tide
Sail by the talisman

We approach the other side
Of the ocean with the tide
In our favour just for once
Welcome greeting our new land
The elation in our hearts
The excitement in our veins
As we sail towards the coastline
Of our golden promised land

Weary limbs fatigued away
I have no life left in me
No more strength and nothing
Left to give
Must find the will to live

Never thought that we could make it
Truly sight of shores divine
the sickness I am dying from
Never wanted it to end this way

Westwards the tide
Westwards we sail on
westwards the tide
Sail by the talisman

As he travels on the beast of Burden
Moving up along the mountain side
As he gazes looking down the valley
No regrets but his pride

As he journeys across mountain passes
And significant sweeps overhand
His reflection of the beauty around him
Feeling empty inside

He is running from his wildest thoughts
He is running from his everything
He is looking now to find something
Hoping he could be saved

He's searching for the answer now
Is something that he's managed to avoid up 'till now
Looking for the conviction that he craves
He needs to find the answer sooner or later

Pushed himself to the limits
He had to strife for all the harder things in life
But what the cost to give him now
His life and time are the only things that he has

Life is is not a rehearsal, only has this the one chance to get it right
Living really is only way to know
Maybe one day they ll forgive him what he's done
with all the pain of lying too early in the grave

Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace

Just to make his peace with God
All is forgivable but he's left a little late
Trying something that he's not
Is impossible to change such a lot

He's taken someone s life away
There s not a day that goes by he regrets what he's done
He should have found another way
From the good book says an eye for an eye

In reflecting on decisions that were made
On the judgements that will haunt him till his grave
No-one has the right to take another life
But in his mind he had no choice so be it

Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace

Destiny, no good to hide away
Hear us now, we ll be his only way
understand , no good to run away
Hear us now, we ll be his saving grace

Far, far away
The man who would be king
Far, far away
The man who would be king

Have you heard what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard, have you heard?

He sees them in the distance where the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror, see an old man now
Does it matter they survive somehow?

They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing you can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know, did you know?

As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

Have you seen what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what they said about us all?
Do you know what is happening to just every one of us
Have you heard, have you heard?

There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it, it will never be the same
Did you know, did you know?

He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never know

They tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know, did you know?

He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face, saying grace
Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago will be gone

They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come

They make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss; just sit and wait

Can't believe all the lying,
All the screams are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors unite all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome

I can't believe all the lying,
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

When they found them, had their arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout,
Just another when the wild wind blows...

Here is the soul of a man
Here in this place for the taking
Clothed in white, stand in the light
Here is the soul of a man

Time to speak with the shaman again
Conjure the jester again
Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
So here is the soul of a man

When the world was virgin
Before the coming of men
Just a solar witness
The beginning of the end
From a world of magma
To a cold rock face
The ascent of madness
And a human race

We are strange believers, all of us
There are stranger truths, immortal lust
We rise from slumber, he calls our name
Recalls our number, abide with pain

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

To God's illusion
Which I recall
Was our delusion
Before the fall
The angels come and the angels go
But the lord of light shining below

Eternal blackness beyond the stars
We think our wisdom will get that far
At the master's table, the table's bare
No land of plenty, devastation, despair

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Good day, my name is Necropolis
I am formed of the dead
I am the harvester of the soul meat
And I suck the lives from around my bed
My own two sons I gave them breath
And I filled their living corpses with my bile
What humanity I knew I have long forgotten
For me eternity is nothing
But a short while

Another time, another place
A hollow universe in space
I took a trip to see the sights
I will be blacker than the night

One way ticket, no returns
My shooting star—so fast it burns
On the edge that you can't see
Let's shot the moon, you and me
I'm not particular you see
Just a lonesome galaxy

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

I'll say a mass for you and wave
Shootin' plasma from my grave
Event horizon lost in space
Runnin' in a human race

I don't know where, I don't know when
But somehow back there time again
I'm on the edge that you can't see
I'm not particular at night
A single particle of me
You won't be trackin' me by sight

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light

We slip into the night

Winter softly falling to the ground
Calmly waiting, don't you hear a sound?

When the world has fallen to the depths below
Where the future's open and the fear has grown

And the path to follow to the great unknown
Where the dark has fallen and the seed is sown

In the selfish hearts of some
The nightmare's coming
With the spilling blood of others
Now wringing through

Now the cup is spilling over
Wake to news of death
And the prophecy of sages
Destiny is met

To the depths of human mind
The cry is burning
With the mentor's anger
Of the lesson ringing true

And for those who live by and are dying by the sword
They will take their ideals with them
Justify their end

Where the fools are lying and the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone

Where the sons are dying
Hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire
Begins again

Never ending the desires of men
It'll never be the same or calm again
In a time of changing hearts
And great unknown
It'll be the damnation and end of us all

Where the fools are lying
And the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone

Where the sons are dying
Hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire begins again

Never ending the desires of men
It'll never be the same or calm again
In a time of changing hearts
And great unknown
It'll be the damnation and of end of us all

When the world has fallen and we stand alone...

The morals of life and the perils of death
Take the wrong way out, running out of breath
Meet my match in the afterlife
Suppress the demons that plague the night

A tortured mind is a safe place to go
But the truth lurks down in the dark below
Step inside my inquisitive mind
Are you scared at what you just might find?

See myself in the hall of mirrors
A different shape every step I take
A different mind every step of the line
But in the end they are all mine

Laughing sorrow inside your head
Can't get out, just a feeling of dread
I know this burden is a heavy load
A dark mistake, never ending road

The black jack king and the red queen clash
The artful dodger, he counts his stash
The joker's wild like an impish child
While Madame Fortune, she waits inside

The good luck charm is overkill
The tired old soldier says fire at will
Planes overhead go search, destroy
The ones below human decoy

I need somebody to save me

Meanwhile we play the waiting game
The clock is struck, the horse is lame
And when we think that this is done
Chance your luck a four leafed one

You hedge your bets, the battle lost
To wait in vain and count the cost
The thin edged line
Between good and bad
And cast the luck, be happy, sad

I need somebody to save me

The red and the black
People don't want the truth
Look in their eyes and you send them away

The red and the black
Fate and hypocrisy
Burden's a heavy load there is no doubt

The red and the black
All out of luck again
How many chances can anyone have?

The red and the black
Treachery out to win
There in the wrong place and at the wrong time

I need somebody to save me

Look for something that is hard to find
Searching somewhere deep inside your mind
Hope you find just what you're looking for
Heaven's waiting with an open door

If you should sell your soul as cheaply as I did then
The road to ruin is a long road to hide in
We signed our lives away to have an escape
It's something that will be whatever our fate

There's no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can't take no more lying
This is the last

There's no time for crying
When some of us are dying
None of us decide what is our fate

Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Is this the last together? maybe this time now
We stand together and we're holding the line here
There's nothing we can do just sit here and wait
The die is cast that is deciding our fate

There's no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can't take no more lying
This is the last

There's no time for crying
When some of us are dying
None of us decide what is our fate

Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Sacrifices buried with kings
Accompany them on a journey with no end
To an afterlife that's rich with fruit of all the gods
And to face the demons
Of their underworld haunts

The sentient is sent to seek out all the truth
A flight to Earth that is a given from his birth
To rise from ashes of the dead
Out of the fire is sent to fulfill man's desire

By power day and night and death he ruled them
The sky and earth and the fires too
Two-headed reptile symbol of his reign
Universes of the underworld

A life that's full of all the wealth and riches
Can never last for an eternity
After living in a golden paradise
The ultimate sacrifice

Prophecy of sky gods
The sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon

Falling of ages
Forest of kings
The search for truth, the book of souls

The rulers of planets and stars
The power of the kings, of traders and the wars
Planetary cycles and the phases of the moon
Is in the document a kingdom they will learn

They were praying to the gods of nature
And were living in the cities of stone
Towers reaching upward to the heavens
Sacred wonders for the world unknown

Make their lives be a mystery no more
Records kept and the passing of laws
Sacred gods to the book of lies
When a civilization dies

Prophecy of sky gods
The sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon

Falling of ages
Forest of kings
The lost book of souls, destruction begins

Ascending the throne wearing feathers and shells
He brought back their lives from the void
Alien invasion brings nothing but death
Mass exodus and plant life destroyed

Domain of the earth to the journey of truth
The underworld caves Mayan slaves

Defeat of the dark lords
The ultimate proof
In the place where the ancestors rule

The book of souls

I see the enemy, I know he can't see me
Combat red in tooth and claw
Ready now for one more score

Took a bullet in my brain
Inside I'm the king of pain
Outside you will fear my name
I ride a blood red triplane

Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong

Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame

Death or glory, I'm in the game of
Death or glory, a one way train

I watch you spiral down
Dead before you hit the ground
Bullet got you in the back
Deflection shooting beam attack

I shoot the gunner first
I kill to quench my thirst
I hunt the weakest prey
Live to fly another day

Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong

Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame

Death or glory
I'm in the game of
Death or glory
A one way train

Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong

Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame

Death or glory
I'm in the game of
Death or glory
A one way train

Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame

Death or glory
I'm in the game of
Death or glory
A one way train

Wandering aimlessly in a cold dark mist I follow
Walking in a dark world that's been
Kissed with sadness
Without sunlight things are born
To the dead of nightmares
Soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness

Listen closely to the raven's call
Praying hard for our world not to end
Try as might to make sense of it all
Will it be for the penance of men
Follow north for the call of the wild
Look all out for a small wayward child
Lay in fear as the dark raven crows
Look for guidance from the one who knows
He lived on this earth for a time and a half
Playing a tune to the old man's laugh
The fear that's inside the men of the oath
In the script of the book that he wrote

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

As the raven again passes by
I can hear all the wake fathers cry
That the first born of all men will die
That their lives will be taken from them
Face the danger a battle of wills
Strength and courage a cure for all ills
We believe in that thou shall not kill
But others are ready to spill
The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I'll take my last breath

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I'll take my last breath

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

Into the valley of death fear no evil
We will go forward no matter the cost
Into the valley of death follow me now
Bring me your souls and I'll make it our last

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die
Mind over matter, cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

All alone in a crowded room
He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemed

But never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despise

The false smile maketh of the man
Glass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown

All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truth
There's something that inside has died

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown

Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

Who motivates the motivator?
Façade it has to go
He knows it sooner or later
Smile for the camera, all OK
But tomorrow is another day he must get through

He had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun where did it go

We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we'll never know

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown

Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown

Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling down
Tears of a clown

Tear of a clown...

Like a man without a home
Watching people come and go
Carry on their daily lives
Without a thought for the ones alone

Cast the dream aside like throwing
A pebble into the ocean tide
And I'm feeling so alone again

Free the angry from their pain
Free the captives from their chains
Cast aside the doubt that
Nothing good can come their way again

Living in a world of lies
No matter how or hard we try
Living life without a dream today

Looking through a mist of truth
That we believe an elusive cloud
The things we find are hard to say now
That we live through day to day
Find it hard to force the reasons
Why we find it hard to die

Now we need to know the truth now
Open our eyes that we can see
So we live and breathe again
Better days for you and me
Can we even hope to deliver this
We are so far away

As one turns against the other
With a brother against brother
Situation like no other
It's a picture of despair

As we look to see the man of sorrows
Passing knowledge to those who don't know
As we watch all our friends passing over
As they pass through the edges of time

And we see what's ahead that awaits us
That no longer do we feel afraid
So we look to see the man of sorrows
And the light is the darkness no more

As we look to see the man of sorrows
Passing knowledge to those who don't know
As we watch all our friends passing over
As they pass through the edges of time

And we see what's ahead that awaits us
That no longer do we feel afraid
So we look to see the man of sorrows
And the light is the darkness no more


To ride the storm, to an empire of the clouds
To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come
To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion

Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
Gray Lady, giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms
"The millionth chance," they laughed, "to take down His Majesty's craft."
"To India," they say, "magic carpet float away," an October fateful day

Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew
The morning sunrise, red before the blue
Hanging at the mast, waiting for command
His majesty's airship, the R101

She's the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies
For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside
Drum roll tight, her canvas skin, silvered in the sun
Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come

The fury yet to come….

In the gathering gloom, the storm rising in the West
The Coxswain stared into the plunging weather glass
We must go now, we must take our chance with fate
We must go now, for a politician, he can't be late

The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch,
But the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch
She never flew at full speed, a trial never done
Her fragile outer cover, her Achilles would become
An Achilles yet to come...

Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
Loyal to the king, and an airship creed
The engines drum, the telegraph sounds
Release the cords that bind us to the ground

Said the Coxswain, "Sir, she's heavy, she'll never make this flight."
Said the Captain, "Damn the cargo! We'll be on our way tonight."
Groundlings cheered in wonder, as she backed off from the mast
Baptizing them her water, from the ballast fore and aft
Now she slips into our past…

Fighting the wind as it rolls you,
Feeling the diesels that push you along
Watching the Channel below you,
Lower and lower, into the night

Lights are passing below you
Northern France, asleep in their beds
Storm is raging around you,
A million to one, that's what he said

Reaper standing beside her
With his scythe cuts to the bone
Panic to make a decision
Experienced men, asleep in their graves

Her cover is ripped and she's drowning
Rain is flooding into the hull
Bleeding to death and she's falling
Lifting gas is draining away

"We're down lads!" came the cry, bow plunging from the sky
Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
The flares to guide her path ignited at the last
The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past
Just ashes at the last…

Here lie their dreams as I stand in the sun
On the ground where they built, and the engines did run
To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?
Oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on

Dreams live on
Dreams live on

Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east
The empire of the clouds may rest in peace
And in a country churchyard, laid head to the mast
Eight and forty souls, who came to die in France…

Beat the warning the sound of the drums
Set the beacons afire for them all
Call to arms all the men far and wide
Have to fight now for dynasty pride at stake

The invaders repel from the north
Keep out nomads who come from the plains
Northern grasslands awash with them all
Blocking the tribes that invade from the south of us

Rallying round to the call
We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall
So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall

Survive on ledges bitten in dust
Knowledge and virtue is stricken by lust
Really believe that they're coming for us
Dancing on graves
Of those who bled for us

Driven away by our endless desire
Defeat by anger and our greatest fire
Attack again and try as they might
Hold them again and see them running

Rallying round to the call
We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall
So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall

Hear them coming - Ready now we wait
Must be steadfast - Must be patient

Must believe in - That we can win
What will save us - The great wall

Now under siege have the real strength to hold them now
Have to believe that we can repel them
Faith in the years our ancestors taught us
Have the belief that we can protect the wall

Try if they can we will overthrow them
Fight to the last they can never own us
Battle of wills we'll fight to the last man
Honour our dead so they never fought in vain

Hold our fortune - Avenge the merciful
Hold the great wall - Never fall again

Arrows falling - Dark oblivion - Live in spirit - Live to tell our sons

Rallying round to the call
We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall
So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall

How do you read a madman's mind
Teach me the art of war
For I shall bring more
Than you bargained for

Give me an ultimatum
That I could not dream of
Spills of a crying nation
Upon my soul

For I have not a mortal soul
That you already know
Look at my eyes
There's no surprise

Ocean is black the devil's track
Looking beyond beneath the sea
Eye of the storm is here again
Been there before you were ever born

Beyond the dark I feel the pain
It's hidden but I can't explain
A cross to bear
A heavy faith
My sorrow whispers
Time again

I hear you calling my name
Come to claim my life again
Pray for me I'm almost there
The pain almost too much to bear

I try to find my way back home
To feel the same again
The voice of nothing
Listened far too long

Little by little eat away
I think I've lost my mind
Too late to change now
What I left behind

Hear me listen my call
I am ready to fall
Lord hear me now - let me go

Ocean is black the devil's track
Looking beyond beneath the sea
Eye of the storm is here again
Been there before you were ever born

Beyond the dark I feel the pain
It's hidden but I can't explain
A cross to bear
A heavy faith
My sorrow whispers
Time again

Across a painted desert lies a train of vagabonds
All that's left of what we were it's what we have become
Once our empires glorious but now the empire's gone
The dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done

Now we are victorious, we've become our slaves
A land of hope and glory building graveyards for the brave

Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding?

Holding on to fury is that all we ever know
Ignorance our judge and jury all we've got to show
From Hollywood to Babylon ~ holy war to kingdom come
On a trail of dust and ashes ~ when the burning sky is done
A tide of change is coming and that is what you fear
The earthquake is a coming but you don't want to hear
You're just too blind to see

Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding, riding next to you?

Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?

Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding, riding next to you?

All is not it seems to be on the outside
Sometimes what appears to be is a show
What shows in the face is only a mirror
We all have some better places to go

We don't know just what we have 'til we've lost it
Until that time comes and know that it's gone
So hard to say things that we should have uttered long ago
Tear myself away from thoughts in my head

The people worshiping the sun
And all the children point up to the sky
They see the eagle as it floats on the wind
And they follow with their spirits high

Buffalo roam on the plain
We walk in to the flames but dance for rain
The hallowed dead in sacred ground and the elders
And we wash away their sins for them

Feel the spirits of the old ones standing proud upon their race
And the testament to ancestors ~ that are never to retrace
Burn the flame of innocence ~ as they ride into the sun
Thinking now of our forefathers that are lying dead upon
Holy ground and sacred earth now
Revisit stolen youth

Lost in a lost world
Buried on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying on sacred ground...

Lost in a lost world
Buried on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying on sacred ground...

Lost in a lost world
Standing on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying on sacred ground...

Will we ever heal our old wounds
Like forever darkness worn
Fighting for their lives again
So come on now don't be afraid

This is where destiny lies
Just to let us breathe again
Put upon this earth to wander
And to walk ~ forever lost

With the ashes of our enemies
To live among our ghosts
Of our past fear nothing
Life is but a better path to joy

Nowhere to go nowhere to run
Our whole nation overrun
Itself existence under threat
And soon will be none of us left

Remember names of all our dead now
In enemies that fled
Reaching for our sky forever free
A sadness that is proud

As the clouds all drift away now
Until we meet again

A war in heaven in god's rage
He put me in this burning cage
Holy fury locks me in
Imprisoned by my deadly sin

Every hour the shadow king
Wonders what his clock will bring
I've lived and loved and that's for sure
My fatal quest forever more

The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die for evermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

Once crucified you forgave it all
But my own life condemned to fall
Where's the glory in your name
My twisted soul still burns in flame

Hark you angels hear my call
Father witness to my fall
Between the lines of sin and pain
I walk the earth now doomed again

The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die for evermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die for evermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die for evermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

Put to the sword by an impish whim
Follow me now to a place we begin

Wrought with no anger, wrought with no fear
Devilish children playing here

Hidden in silence, below barren waste
Confusion hunger, am I still awake?

Have I ever told you about my time machine
Sit you down I'll tell you everywhere I've been

I have lived a long life, life extraordinaire
Let me tell you about it, let me take you there

Does it really matter, it's all in the mind
Let me tell you about it, listen what you'll find

I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done

I have lived a long life, I have seen the world
I could tell you stories, hair will stand on end

Stand among the steeples, stand upon the walls
I have seen a god's face, I have no disgrace

I have seen the gods cry, howling in the wind
Where do I get started, when can I begin

I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done

Sleep with a light that is dark to my eyes
Father and sons give me all of your lies

The brutal truth, that is never a lie
Full moon is out, as you look to the sky

I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done

Open your heart and I'll open your soul
Even in quieter moments I know

I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done

Eerie collection, darkness is there, wedded to danger
Betrothed to despair

We buried our sons, we turned and fled
No growing old, the glorious dead
But we came back because one man said
Now on the beaches the blood runs red

I faced them down, the only one
I stood alone and warned the day would come
But they were wrong, appeasers every one
And not for the last time, we all stand alone

I watch the sun move away as I embrace the night
And my black dog has its day for six long years you shall not pass
Barbarians at the gates, we will overcome

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped
The whirlwind before the dawn
The darkest hour
The darkest hour

To blaze in glory like a dying sun
One last burning giant till Jupiter moves on
Turn the ploughshares into swords
You sons of Albion awake defend this sacred land

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn the darkest hour
The darkest hour

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn the darkest hour

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn the darkest hour
Before the dawn the darkest hour

The road it winds uphill all the way
Ride to glory on this day
Remember now to do him so proud
In God we trust, cry it out loud

Redeem my salve of winning ways
Remember all the darkest days
Of that I know will see me tread
Walketh upon the field of the dead

The burden of blood, the breaketh of bone
The battlefield now I make it my own
The glory of the morning we make
Praying the rose is still awake

Lord above, my spirit says
Death is not proud, no more, no less
Power of my soul will be free
Deliver us on to victory

Wither a pain that's almost a joy
Wander there, my heart will destroy
Dreaming of days of our youth again
Strangely, no wonder memories remain
Pour thy scorn upon the realm
Pity me none at the gates of our hell
For I am but a messenger one
Sent to do reckoning, what must be done

Praying to our wretched doom
Liberty, freedom, maybe death looms
Wishing upon a fair display
Hoping our cause done, faithfully

Wayward thunder over rain
Giving me time to think again
Send to their graves on this day
Silent where the battle dead lay

Vengeance is for all who lay dead
I have no fear, my body has bled
I will live on in rebirth again
Come to me now, embrace it my friend

Spirits cry for a god from the grave
In darkness, fortune favours the brave

Dying, a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal, for he will live evermore

Dying, a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal, for he will live evermore

Think I am, that I'm almost there
Following now the depths of despair
Beyond the light, darkness will fall
Coming to take the life from us all

Following now where god can't explain
Bidding farewell, a lifeline again
Following those who came from hell
Came to witness the death of the Celts

When the moon will rise again
Until we read the Parthian skin
Broken fears warring days are here again

'Fore we all to dust descend
Heaven knows when life will end
God to know in the mire, put out the fire

Know there is a cross to bear
In your primal quest of fear
No quarter now is given no less

Aslumber was my main ideal
Asunder did my spirit steal
Sceptred race uttered words in disgrace

Sweet revenge will be ours
Vengeance of a shaken world
Just remember that patience is no sin

And to find another way
Live to breathe another day
Lord of light in the darkness, our guide

In a tempest never shaken
Edge of doom is not mistaken
Countenance is not a sin
Gallant king, we bow to him

Fierce as wolf with a leopard skin
Dark and bitter deep within
Invader punished with his life
Vanquished in the morning

Sea of blood in light divine
Unholy reverence enjoyed
Intoxicated with their hell
Man immortal sickness dwell

Savage beasts troops engage
Assembled here to butcher blades

Smoke has darkened in the air
Smell of death and deep despair

Wilderness a tyrant dream
Sell your soul not give them power
Slay upon imperial crown
Witness now the witching hour

Bound himself to oath and king
Such loyalty a shameless thing
Youth of agony still burn
Shedding parents blood

Never say a prayer to me
For this crime and treachery
Drinking from your cup of wisdom true
Many men will follow you

Now an army is raised
And our gods, they be praised
Death is but a gilted edge
Shall no more than we will pledge

Hear the cry we are ready to believe

The prodigal has returned
Give us our own revenge
With the power he learned
We will burn the same again

A betrayal of angels in a foreign land
A revenge for the merciful destiny at hand

For all those who have written
In the sand will be told
That the same will happen ~ searching for gold

Like a fire in the sky
I can feel strength return
Heading for afterlife, meet me there

Beginning of a sunrise bores a big hole in the sky
Not to reason why that
Armed children are in this world
And fighting in the name of God's way
Mourning bleak and utter waste
The vanity of the world is assured now

Prey upon the weak no more
The spirits of those who are gone
Propaganda of the battles
That are lost or won

And count your blessings still alive
Of those who managed to survive
Inside oblivion of that hell on earth

All you have been, all you have seen
Lost in somewhere in your dreams

How the angels they have fallen
All is nothing what it seems

In the voices that you hear now
In the voices in your head
Now are thinking of a lifetime
You can never feel again

I wish I could go back
Will never be the same again
Bled for all upon this hell on earth

And when I leave this world
I hope to see you all again
On the other side of hell on earth

Upon the eyes of good
I'm following the light again
In between the dark of hell on earth

On the other side, I'll see again heaven
So far away from this hell on earth

You dance on the graves who bled for us
Do you really think they'll come for us
Knowledge and virtue taken by lust
Live on the edge of those that you trust

You think that you have all the answers for all
In your arrogant way only one way to fall
Burning a lamp that is fire in your hands
Taking you further from these lands

Love in anger, life in danger
Lost in anger, life in danger

Love in anger, life in danger
Lost in anger, life in danger
